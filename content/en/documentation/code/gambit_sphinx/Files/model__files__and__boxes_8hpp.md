## Detailed Description


**Author**: Ben Farmer ([ben.farmer@gmail.com](mailto:ben.farmer@gmail.com)) 

**Date**: 2014 Dec, 2015 Jan

Flexiblesusy model header includes for SpecBit.

As new models are used in SpecBit, the new required headers should be added here.

The definitions of the MODELbox structs are also here.
