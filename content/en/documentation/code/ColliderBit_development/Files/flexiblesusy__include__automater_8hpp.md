## Detailed Description


**Author**: Ben Farmer ([ben.farmer@gmail.com](mailto:ben.farmer@gmail.com))

This file is part of a trick to perform tedious includes of FlexibleSUSY headers required to use particular models.

It doesn't have include guards on purpose, because in order to use it one has to include it several times, with model name macros defined differently.

## Macros Documentation

### define BUILD_THIS

```
#define BUILD_THIS CAT_3(FS_MODEL_,MODELNAME,_IS_BUILT)
```


We need to decide if we are going to do anything by checking whether GAMBIT was in fact configured to build FlexibleSUSY with whatever model is defined in MODELNAME. Fortunately there is a preprocessor variable defined by CMake which lists these for us. 


## Source code

#if(BUILD_THIS) // If the model wasn't built then don't try to include any of these files!
