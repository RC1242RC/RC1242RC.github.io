title : "Global And Modular BSM Inference Tool"
description: "Welcome to the GAMBIT homepage. GAMBIT is a global fitting code for generic Beyond the Standard Model theories, designed to allow fast and easy definition of new models, observables, likelihoods, scanners and backend physics codes. It can perform statistical global fits of generic physics models using a wide range of particle physics and astrophysics data."
